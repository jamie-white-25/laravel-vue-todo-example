# getting started 
composer install 
php artisan migrate --seed
register and login 
you should see the todo list on the dashboard page. 

# what i've done 
I've used breeze as the auth
I've added vue to create a todo component (i was going to use blade componets, or jetstream but thought this was the best way)
I've used axios for the HTTP requests
I've created api endpoints and test
I've created seeders and factories
