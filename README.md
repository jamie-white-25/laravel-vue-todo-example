# getting started 
set the .env file <br>
composer install <br>
php artisan migrate --seed <br>
register and login <br>
you should see the todo list on the dashboard page. <br>

# what i've done 
I've used breeze as the auth <br>
I've added vue to create a todo component (i was going to use blade componets, or jetstream but thought this was the best way) <br>
I've used axios for the HTTP requests <br>
I've created api endpoints and test <br>
I've created seeders and factories <br>
